# Pong

Build Pong is a popular arcade game that is based on the classic game of Pong. Pong is one of the earliest video games ever created and was released in 1972. It simulates a tennis-like game where two players control paddles on opposite sides of a screen. The objective is to hit a ball back and forth between the paddles without letting it pass behind their own paddle. The game features simple controls and a competitive multiplayer mode that makes it engaging and enjoyable. Build Pong refers to creating or developing a version of the Pong game, either from scratch or by modifying existing code, as a programming exercise or personal project. It allows individuals to learn about game development, improve their coding skills, and have fun playing a nostalgic and iconic game.
